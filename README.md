# Pygame UI

Since pygame doesnot have any gui features and only draws shapes and handle event loog I decided to make UI components for making menus similar to flutter widget. If you ever created flutter apps this should be easier.
### Features
- Button
- Column
- Row

### Documentation
Common For all:
1. first create an object
2. use `.draw()` method to draw
3. use `.handleEvent(event)` which takes `pygame.event` to handle event.
